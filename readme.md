## What?
Many of the simulations require an old version of Java / Macromedia Flash.
This has all required plugins packaged within it, so you don't have to use old plugin versions globally.

## How?
This is a desktop app packaged with nw.js
Currently targeted for Windows. All you have to really do for OSX/Linux is contribute a link to the plugins.
